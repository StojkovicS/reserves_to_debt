# Reserves to debt

I used publically available World Bank dataset (Wave 7) to calculate total reserves (% of total external debt) a country has at its disposal relative to total external govenrnment debt.
I focused on developing countries only. See the written report here: https://stojkovics.github.io/reserves_to_govdebt.html
